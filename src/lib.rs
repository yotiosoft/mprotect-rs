//! A Rust library for memory protection using `mprotect` and Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK).
//! 
//! This library provides safe abstractions for controlling memory access permissions at runtime,
//! offering both traditional `mprotect`-based memory protection and modern protection key-based
//! access control for fine-grained memory security.
//! 
//! # Features
//! 
//! - **Memory Protection**: Use `mprotect` to set page-level access permissions (read, write, execute)
//! - **Protection Keys (pkey)**: Leverage Intel MPK for thread-local memory access control
//! - **Guard Types**: Type-safe memory regions with automatic permission management
//! - **Multiple Allocators**: Support for both `mmap` and `jemalloc` allocation strategies
